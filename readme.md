# Foam Note

This project is a collection of my graph structure knowledge.

## How to read this note

This note is organized with [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/).

You can read it just like normal Markdown, or clone and open it with Vscode and Foam extension to display the knowledge graph.
